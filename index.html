        <h1>Law 1: Never Outshine the Master</h1>
        <p>Highlight 1: 
          All superiority is odious, but the superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal
        </p>
      <p>This is all I highlighted in this Law or Chapter of the Book, as it is a very easy thing to understand, although examples are given from the past, I feel that this is the most important piece of information</p>
